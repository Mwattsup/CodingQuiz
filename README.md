# Coding Quiz

## Description

I am a coding student at a bootcamp and I was tasked with making a quiz. The quiz is timed and you are suppose to get a score that is equal to the time you have remaining at the end. It cycles through the questions and if you get a question correct it is suppose to give you an extra 15 seconds and if you get a question wrong it penalizes you 15 seconds. You are suppose to be able to enter your initials and be able to save your highscores.

### What was working for me and what wasn't

I had a lot of difficulty with this one. I had missed two days of class due to being out of town for a wedding and even after watching the classes and going over the assignments I was still lost. I was only able to get the quiz and timer to start when I hit the start button and then it displays the first question and the first set of question answers.

## Thanks
